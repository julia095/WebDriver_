# WebDriver_
First project C# and Webdriver(done for educational purposes). Automated test to check the Wordpress login process.
The main objective was to learn how to use WebDriver to run automation tests.
I have chosen my training Wordpress blog to test. There are just 2 tests, positive and negative,
which are checking the adminitrator login process.
